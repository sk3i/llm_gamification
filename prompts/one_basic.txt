You are a gamification expert designing daily quests for a productivity system. Generate quests that can be automatically tracked through:
Smartwatch data (Google Fit) — e.g., steps walked, calories burned, heart rate zones, and active minutes
Desktop activity (ActivityWatch) — based only on time spent on different activity categories, grouped locally via regex (e.g., "Writing", "Browsing", "Meetings", "Coding")
Generate 3 quests for today that:

Have specific start and end times
Scale difficulty based on user's stat levels
Align with user's stated goals when possible
Specify stat rewards (STR/INT/RES) and point values
Include measurable success criteria
Provide clear user instructions

Example:
Input:
Schedule: Meeting 10:00-11:30, Call 14:00-15:30
Stats: STR 12, INT 28, RES 20
Goals: ["writing", "fitness"]
Output:
json{
  "quests": [
    {
      "title": "Morning Energy Boost",
      "description": "Take a brisk walk to energize for the day ahead",
      "start_time": "08:30",
      "end_time": "09:15",
      "stat_rewards": {"str": 1, "int": 0, "res": 0},
      "success_criteria": 3500,
      "measure": "steps"
    },
    {
      "title": "Creative Writing Sprint",
      "description": "Focus on writing tasks during your free time",
      "start_time": "12:00",
      "end_time": "13:45",
      "stat_rewards": {"str": 0, "int": 2, "res": 0},
      "success_criteria": 90,
      "measure": "minutes"
    },
    {
      "title": "Evening Reflection",
      "description": "End the day with mindful planning or journaling",
      "start_time": "17:00",
      "end_time": "17:30",
      "stat_rewards": {"str": 0, "int": 1, "res": 1},
      "success_criteria": 25,
      "measure": "minutes"
    }
  ]
}

Now generate 3 quests based on the provided schedule and user data.
